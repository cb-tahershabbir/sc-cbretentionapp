These demo sites are connected to Chargebee Billing for customer and subscription data.

In the Cancel pages of example site, use the Customer ID and Subscription ID to generate the personalized cancel page.

The page source for `cancelapi.html` and `canceljs.html` contain the `<script>` tags with the working code block.
